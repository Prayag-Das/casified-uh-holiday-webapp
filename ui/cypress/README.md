# What's in here?
In the 'cypress' folder, we keep
tests that use Cypress, an open-source
end-to-end testing framework for web applications.
Cypress is designed to be developer-friendly,
providing a robust and easy-to-use
tool for writing, running, and debugging
tests for modern web applications.

## Cypress Features

- End-to-End Testing: Cypress allows
you to test the entire application
workflow from start to finish.
This includes interacting with
the user interface, making
- network requests, and verifying
the final state of the application.
- Real-Time Reloads: As you
make changes to your tests or
application code, Cypress automatically
reloads and re-runs the tests, providing
immediate feedback.
- Time Travel: Cypress captures
snapshots as your tests run.
You can hover over commands in
the Command Log to see exactly
what happened at each step.
- Debugging Capabilities:
Cypress provides powerful
debugging tools.
You can use the built-in
developer tools to inspect
your application at any point in the test.
- Automatic Waiting: Cypress
automatically waits for commands
and assertions before moving on,
ensuring that tests are
not flaky due to timing issues.
- Network Traffic Control: You can
stub and mock network requests and
responses, allowing you to test edge
cases and error handling without
relying on external services.
- Cross-Browser Testing: Cypress
supports running tests across
multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- Easy Setup and Configuration:
Cypress is easy to install and configure.
It does not require additional
setup for the test environment,
making it accessible for developers.
- Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:
Cypress can be integrated with
continuous integration and continuous deployment
pipelines, making it a good
choice for automated testing
in a development workflow.
- Rich Ecosystem: Cypress has
a rich ecosystem of plugins and
extensions, allowing you to extend
its functionality to suit your testing needs.
