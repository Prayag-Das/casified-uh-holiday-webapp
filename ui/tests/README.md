# What's in here?
In the 'tests' folder, we store
test classes for our app's various
components and pages, which can be found in the
corresponding folder. The main
purpose of test classes is to
verify that the code in the
classes being tested behaves as expected.
They help ensure that changes
to the codebase do not introduce
new bugs or issues.

## Additional Resources
We primarily use JEST, a
Javascript testing framework,
which you can learn more about
here: <https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started>
