# What's in here?
In the 'public' folder, we store items
that we use commonly for easy access.
In the data sub-folder, we have data
that is easily accessible from any
part of the parent directory.

Seal.svg contains the UH Manoa seal
used in our navbar component, the
'fonts' folder holds the custom fonts
used in the globals.css classes,
and the 'data' folder contains
data used for test classes.
