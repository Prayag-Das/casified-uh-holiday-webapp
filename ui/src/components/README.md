# What's in here?
The 'components_' folder contains
the building blocks of our pages.
Rather than writing all our visual
elements into each page, we use components
to create small pieces of pages,
which in some cases, will have more than
one application. These are then
imported to the pages, where they
are stitched together. This saves
us both development time, and space.
A couple of examples of commonly
used components are the
'navbar' and the 'footer.'
The single-use components are
stored with their respective pages,
and components with various
usages, are kept in this folder.

## Atomic Components
Atomic components do not
contain any subcomponents.
Many of the components we will
use will consist of atomic
components that are both
imported and written by us.

Codevolution has a wonderful
video with specifics on how
components work in web applications:
